		<h2>Troubleshooting Methods</h2>
		<p>Troubleshooting is about understanding how things work, finding problems, and 
		using a step-by-step process to fix them.</p>
		
	

    <div class="troubleshooting-step">
       <!-- <h2>1. Identify the Problem 🔍</h2>-->
       
        <h1>1. Gathering Information from the User 🗣️</h1>
        <p>When a problem happens, the first report usually comes from a user or another technician. They can provide useful 
		details if you ask the right questions. Before checking settings or taking the computer apart, gather information from the user about the issue.</p>
        
        <h3>Important Questions to Ask:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>What error messages appear on the screen?</li>
            <li>Is anyone else having the same problem?</li>
            <li>How long has the problem been happening?</li>
            <li>Has anything changed on the system recently? Where there any changes recently?</li>
            <li>Have you already tried to fix the problem? What actions did you perform?</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="troubleshooting-step">
        <h2>Performing Backups 💾</h2>
        <p>Before making any changes to fix the issue, consider the important files stored on the computer. Check when the last backup was made. If there is no recent backup, try to back up important data before changing any system settings.</p>
    </div>
   

    <div class="troubleshooting-step">
        		
		<h1>2. Understanding the Problem and Researching Solutions</h1>

    <div class="troubleshooting-step">
        <h2>Gathering Information 🔍</h2>
        <p>Asking the right questions helps you understand how serious a problem is, how many people are affected, and what part of the system might be causing it. The issue could come from a recent change, an error in the setup, or something unexpected like a hardware failure or network issue.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="troubleshooting-step">
        <h2>Diagnosing the Problem 🛠️</h2>
        <p>To fix a problem, you need to recognize the symptoms. Once you know what usually causes those symptoms, you can test different possibilities to find the real issue.</p>

        <p>For example, if a computer won’t connect to the internet, you might ask:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Is the network cable plugged in properly?</li>
            <li>Is the Wi-Fi turned on?</li>
            <li>Is the router or modem having issues?</li>
            <li>Is there an outage in the area?</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Troubleshooting works the same way for any problem. You go through a list of possible causes carefully so you don’t miss anything and solve the issue as quickly as possible.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="troubleshooting-step">
        <h2>Conducting Research 🔎</h2>
        <p>Sometimes, users can’t explain a problem clearly. That’s why researching is an important troubleshooting skill. Learn how to quickly find useful information using:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Online searches and IT support forums</li>
            <li>Manufacturer (vendor) support pages</li>
            <li>Internal documents and system logs</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="troubleshooting-step">
        <h2>Inspecting the System 🧐</h2>
        <p>Look and listen for signs of trouble, such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A burnt smell from the power supply</li>
            <li>Unusual beeping sounds during startup</li>
            <li>A hard drive making clicking noises</li>
            <li>A fan that isn’t running, causing overheating</li>
        </ul>

        <p>If the issue isn’t obvious, try to recreate the problem by repeating the same steps that caused it. Some problems happen randomly, making them harder to find.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="troubleshooting-step">
        <h2>Checking Logs and Consulting Others 📋</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Review system logs, error messages, and diagnostic tools for clues.</li>
            <li>Talk to other technicians who may have worked on the system.</li>
            <li>Consider that another team (like network administrators) may have made recent changes without informing you.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="troubleshooting-step">
        <h2>Using Online Resources 🌍</h2>
        <p>Check vendor websites, forums, and online support pages. Many problems are common and may already have a solution available.</p>
    </div>
		
		
		
		
		
    </div>

    <div class="troubleshooting-step">
        <h2>3. Test Your Theory 🧪</h2>
        <p>Once you think you know what might be causing the problem, test your idea. Start with simple fixes, like restarting the computer or checking 
		if cables are plugged in correctly. If that doesn’t work, try other small changes based on what the problem seems to be. 
		Testing helps you figure out if you were right or if you need to look for another cause.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="troubleshooting-step">
        <h2>4. Create a Plan of Action 📋</h2>
        <p>If your test confirms the issue, plan how to fix it. Make sure your solution won’t cause new problems before making changes.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="troubleshooting-step">
        <h2>5. Implement the Solution ⚙️</h2>
        <p>Follow your plan and fix the issue. Be careful and take your time to ensure everything is done correctly.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="troubleshooting-step">
        <h2>6. Verify Full System Functionality ✅</h2>
        <p>After applying the fix, check everything to make sure the system is working properly again. Test different functions to confirm that the problem is gone.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="troubleshooting-step">
        <h2>7. Document the Process 📝</h2>
        <p>Write down what the problem was, what you did to fix it, and the final results. This helps others and makes future troubleshooting easier.</p>
